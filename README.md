## Overview

In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto in his whitepaper titled "Bitcoin Whitepaper" conceptualized a consensus-based, decentralized network that is secured by using cryptographic hash values. The way this blockchain works is, when a contributor or "miner" wants to add a new block to the chain (transaction) they must do some work that is approved by all the nodes on the blockchain. This work generally involves solving a mathematical problem (Hash Value) by finding a valid nonce for that block. This concept is known as the Proof of Work protocol.

This project aims at designing a quantum key distribution algorithm to secure all blockchain transactions. QKD is a cryptographic protocol that generates secret or private keys whichc are in entangled state. QKD is currently symmetric i.e. it does not provide a means to authenticate the QKD transmission source. Most blockchain make use of asymmetric or public-key cryptography which allows authentication using digital signatures. Examples include RSA and Eliptical Curve Crytopgraphy. Once the algorithm is made we can use it to create our very own quantum crypto-wallet by using JavaScript.
